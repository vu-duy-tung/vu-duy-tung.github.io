I am a senior Computer Science student at VinUniversity, actively engaged in research across Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Multimodal Learning, and Speech. I am currently exploring and identifying a research direction that I would like to commit to for the next several years, with a focus on applied approaches that can translate into impactful, real-world systems.

<!-- I love dogs, cats, and kids.

I love football and always miss the days when I used to play with the gang every day.

The manga I like most is Space Brother. -->
