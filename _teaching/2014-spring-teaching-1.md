In this course, I prepare the materials including documents, slides, and demo for GraphRAG lecture. The lecture delves into the innovative approaches of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), focusing on the synergy between graph-based data structures and generative models. The lecture primarily draws from the comprehensive survey by Peng et al. [1], as well as practical insights from the Neo4j Developer Blog on integrating Neo4j with LangChain [2].
