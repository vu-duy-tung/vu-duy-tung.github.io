In this course, I prepare the materials including documents, slides, and demo for GraphRAG lecture. The lecture delves into the innovative approaches of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), focusing on the synergy between graph-based data structures and generative models. The lecture primarily draws from the comprehensive survey by Peng et al. [1], as well as practical insights from the Neo4j Developer Blog on integrating Neo4j with LangChain [2].

2. **Preliminaries**
   - **Text-Attributed Graphs**
   - **Graph Neural Networks**

3. **Overview of GraphRAG**
   - **Problem definition and conceptual framework**

4. **Graph-Guided Indexing**
   - **Graph data**
   - **Indexing**

5. **Graph-Guided Retrieval**
   - **Retriever**
   - **Retrieval Paradigm**
   - **Retrieval Granularity**
   - **Retrieval Enhancement**

6. **Graph-Enhanced Generation**
   - **Generation Techniques**
   - **Graph Formats**
   - **Generation Enhancement**

7. **Applications** : Examples of industries and domains where GraphRAG is being or can be applied, such as healthcare, finance, and legal tech.

8. **Related Works**
   - **GraphRAG by NebulaGraph**
   - **GraphRAG by Microsoft**
   - **GRAG**

9. **Demo**: Practical insights on implementing GraphRAG with Neo4j and LangChain, offering a hands-on perspective
