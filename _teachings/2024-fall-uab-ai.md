## Course Information

This is a description of my teaching experience at The University of Alabama at Birmingham for CS660/CS760, the Artificial Intelligence course.

In this course, I prepared the materials including documents, slides, and demo for GraphRAG lecture. The lecture delves into the innovative approaches of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), focusing on the synergy between graph-based data structures and generative models. The lecture primarily draws from the comprehensive survey by Peng et al. [1], as well as practical insights from the Neo4j Developer Blog on integrating Neo4j with LangChain [2].

   - Graph Neural Networks

3. **Overview of GraphRAG**
   - Problem definition and conceptual framework

4. **Graph-Guided Indexing**
   - Graph data
   - Indexing

5. **Graph-Guided Retrieval**
   - Retriever
   - Retrieval Paradigm
   - Retrieval Granularity
   - Retrieval Enhancement

6. **Graph-Enhanced Generation**
   - Generation Techniques
   - Graph Formats
   - Generation Enhancement

7. **Applications**
   - Examples of industries and domains where GraphRAG is being or can be applied, such as healthcare, finance, and legal tech

8. **Related Works**
   - GraphRAG by NebulaGraph
   - GraphRAG by Microsoft
   - GRAG

9. **Demo**
   - Practical insights on implementing GraphRAG with Neo4j and LangChain, offering a hands-on perspective
